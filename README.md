# Arizona-Rooftop-Solar-Mapper
Web application designed to assess and visualize the potential for rooftop solar panel installations across major cities in Arizona. The tool aims to provide valuable insights for homeowners, solar installers, urban planners, and policymakers to optimize the expansion of rooftop solar in the state.

- Pandas

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd Arizona-Rooftop-Solar-Mapper
3. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the app: streamlit run app.py

## Usage

1. Select a city from the dropdown menu in the sidebar.
2. The map will display all buildings in the selected city, color-coded based on their solar potential.
3. Zoom over to the city ( Automation work in progress..)
4. Hover over a building to see detailed information about its solar potential and estimated savings (Translates to $ generated by solar).
5. View overall statistics for the city in the sidebar.
